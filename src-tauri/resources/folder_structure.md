# Ligeia Virtual Folder Structure (Simplified & Optimized)

This document describes the optimized virtual folder hierarchy used in Ligeia for organizing audio files. The structure follows cognitive load principles and audio library best practices.

## Design Philosophy

Based on research into cognitive load theory and audio library organization:
- **Maximum 3 levels deep** for fast navigation (3-click rule)
- **6 main categories** within human memory limits (7±2 rule)
- **~250 total folders** to minimize decision paralysis
- **Function-based organization** for intuitive discovery
- **Tag-centric approach** - folders for broad organization, tags for detailed classification

## Statistics

- **Total Folders**: 247
- **Root Folders**: 6
- **Folders by Level**:
  - Level 1: 6 folders (main categories)
  - Level 2: 47 folders (subcategories)
  - Level 3: 194 folders (specific types)
