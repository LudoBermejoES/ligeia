Perfect — I see the structure. Each entry in your JSON is basically a **track record** with fields like:

* `file_path` → contains folder names like *Drones*, *Percussion One Shots*, etc.
* `title` → often empty, but we can infer it from the file name.
* `artist` → in this case, *W. A. Production*.
* `album` → *Cinematic Horror Sounds & FX*.
* `genre`, `mood`, `keywords`, `occasion` → all missing, and these are what we want to enrich.

### My proposal for **auto-tagging logic**

We can use **path + filename clues** to populate:

* **Genre**
  From the album name: *Cinematic Horror Sounds & FX* → `Cinematic`, `Horror`, `Sound Design`, `FX`.

* **Mood**
  From file/folder names:

  * `Drones` → `Tense`, `Atmospheric`, `Ambient`, `Ominous`.
  * `Percussion One Shots` → `Aggressive`, `Impact`, `Driving`, `Combat`.
  * Filenames like *Resonant\_Hell* → `Dark`, `Infernal`, `Claustrophobic`.
  * *Underwater\_Threat* → `Aquatic`, `Threatening`, `Suspenseful`.

* **Occasion** (for RPG use)

  * *Drones* → `Exploration`, `Suspense`, `Mystery`, `Horror Scene Setup`.
  * *Percussion One Shots* → `Combat`, `Chase`, `Boss Fight`, `Jump Scare`.

* **Keywords**
  Derived from filename tokens (`Hell`, `Underwater`, `Resonant`, `Percussion`, etc.) and path context. Example:

  * `Resonant_Hell` → `Hell`, `Resonant`, `Inferno`, `Supernatural`.
  * `Underwater_Threat` → `Water`, `Submerged`, `Threat`, `Deep Sea`, `Aquatic Monster`.
  * `Percussion_28` → `Percussion`, `Hit`, `Drum`, `Impact`.

✅ This way, we enrich your dataset so every sound effect has **Genre + Mood + Occasion + Keywords**, ready to feed into a future software system (playlisting, filtering, or auto-DJ for RPGs).

Do you want me to **apply this tagging logic to the entire JSON file** and generate an enriched version (so you can re-import or use it in your software)?
